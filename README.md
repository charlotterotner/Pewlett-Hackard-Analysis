# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the following:
- The number of retiring employees per title
- The employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Results:

The analysis of the PH Retiree employee data shows that: 

- In the retirement_titles table we found that therfe were 133,776 titles that were eligible for retirement. This info represented each role that an employee held during their time at PH, which resulted in employees showing multiple times on this table, since many employees have held multiple positiions. This information was not helpful until we narrowed into down into unique employees.

- There are 72,458 unique employees who are up for retirement in the “silver wave”. This data is supported by taking count of the total number of employees in the “retirment_titles” CSV

- When we pulled a report to see retirees by title the top 3 titles with the most upcoming retirees were Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, and Engineer. The full table with retiree count is pictured below.

- Lastly, there are 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program. 

## Summary:

**How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?** 

72,458 employees positions will need to be filled. 

**Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?** 

There are likely not if we leave the mentorship program eligibility requirements as is. There are 72,458 roles to fill and only 1,549 employee's eligible to mentor. If we lowered the eligible age to mentor we could pool a greater number of employees to assist with mentorship. If we don't want to create a larger pool of mentors the company should consider modifying the pogram to have mutiple mentee's per mentor. With the engineering roles having the greatest number of retirees, I'd recommend the recruiters focus on hiring for those roles first and ensuring the mentorship program is fully built out for the enginneering teams to ensure the engineering department is set up for success!
